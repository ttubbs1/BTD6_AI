# BTD6_AI
This is a very simple BTD6 AI that can play the game by selecting and upgrading towers. It makes one choice per round and uses deep Q-learning to learn. Because finding stable pointers was not bearing fruit, work-a-rounds were made for all but the pointer for the round number. So for the program to work one would need to find a stable pointer for the round value and change the code accordingly. The program also uses various pixel count related things so those would need to be changed depending on the resolution of the screen. Also, things like the money gained each round would need to be changed along with tower prices for modes other than hard/CHIPMS. 
Some of the code could be reworked and simpler if there was stable pointers for money, health, and tower count.
As mentioned this AI is simple so it can't use abilities or targeting and it cannot choose where to place towers as that is currently random. This AI ony learns what towers to pick and what upgrades to get.
